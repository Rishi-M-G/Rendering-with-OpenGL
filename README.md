# 3D Rendering

## Overview

Welcome to the 3D Rendering Progress repository! This repository tracks the development of a 3D rendering project using OpenGL. The primary goal is to demonstrate the learning and progress made over time in creating and manipulating 3D graphics. 

### Day 1

Today marks the first day of this project. The focus was on setting up the basic environment and understanding some of the fundamental components involved in 3D rendering. 

## Concepts Covered

1. **Introduction to Libraries**
   - **GLEW (OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library):** A library used to manage OpenGL extensions.
   - **GLFW:** A library for creating windows and handling input.
   - **SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer):** Another library for managing graphics, input, and other multimedia tasks.

2. **Coding Tasks**
   - **Setup Basic OpenGL Environment:** 
     - Initialized GLFW and set up a window with OpenGL context.
     - Integrated GLEW for managing OpenGL extensions.

   - **Shader Setup and Buffer Management:**
     - Created a basic vertex and fragment shader (commented out for now).
     - Set up vertex array object (VAO) and vertex buffer object (VBO) (commented out for now).

   - **Rendering Loop:**
     - Implemented a rendering loop that clears the window to a red color.
     - Set up for future inclusion of drawing objects and using shaders.
